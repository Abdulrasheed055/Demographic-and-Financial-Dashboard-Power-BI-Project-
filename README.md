## ðŸ“Š Demographic and Financial Dashboard (Power BI Project)

A Power BI project focused on analyzing the relationship between demographic characteristics and financial trends using a structured dataset.

## Project Title
**Demographic and Financial Dashboard using Power BI**


## Aim

To develop an interactive dashboard that visualizes demographic data alongside financial metrics in order to derive actionable insights for workforce planning, social analysis, and economic strategy.


##  Objectives

- Visualize the distribution of gender, education level, and occupation across individuals.
- Explore the relationship between income and demographic factors such as location, education, and dependents.
- Identify the top 10 highest earners and their corresponding profiles.
- Enable interactive filtering by gender, employment status, and location.
- Provide data-driven insights and recommendations based on the analysis.


##  Work Steps / Methodology

1. **Data Loading:**
   - Imported a CSV file (`data sheet batch 9.csv`) into Power BI Desktop.

2. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Cleaned column names for readability.
   - Ensured correct data types for numeric fields like `Income`, `Work_Experience`, and `Number_of_Dependents`.

3. **Data Modeling:**
   - Created calculated columns and measures (e.g., average income).
   - Added filters and slicers for interactivity.

4. **Dashboard Development:**
   - Designed a user-friendly layout divided into:
     - Demographics
     - Income Analysis
     - Experience & Dependents
   - Applied consistent color schemes and visual titles.
   - Enabled slicers and filters (Gender, Location, Employment Status, Marital Status).

5. **Insight Extraction:**
   - Analyzed patterns using visual cues.
   - Documented findings and crafted actionable recommendations.
